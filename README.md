# Plant Diary ðŸŒ±

A full stack web application for plant enthusiasts who want to organize and keep track of the growth/development of their plants.

## Why I Built This

As a plant lover, I've always wanted a place where I can keep track of every single plant that I own. Taking care of multiple plants can be quite overwhelming. I often forget which plant I recently repotted or when exactly was the last time I watered a plant. This is why I built Plant Diary, this application makes it easier for plant lovers to organize all of their plants in one place.
